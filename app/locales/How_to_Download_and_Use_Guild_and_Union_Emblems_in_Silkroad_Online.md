Emblems are displayed next to the guild or union name in the game interface, as well as on the guild or union website. Emblems can also be used to customize items, such as flags, capes, or banners. Emblems can make your guild or union stand out from the crowd and show your pride and loyalty.
 
But how do you download and use guild and union emblems in Silkroad Online? In this article, we will show you the steps to do so.
 
## Step 1: Find an Emblem
 
The first step is to find an emblem that you like and that suits your guild or union theme. You can either create your own emblem using an image editing software, such as Photoshop or Paint.net, or you can download an emblem from online sources.
 
If you want to create your own emblem, you need to follow some requirements:
 
- The emblem must be a 16x16 pixel bitmap image (.bmp format).
- The emblem must have a transparent background.
- The emblem must not contain any offensive or inappropriate content.

If you want to download an emblem from online sources, you need to be careful about the quality and the origin of the emblem. Some emblems may be low-resolution, blurry, or pixelated. Some emblems may also be copyrighted or trademarked by other entities, such as games, movies, or brands.
 
One of the best places to find high-quality and original emblems for Silkroad Online is the elitepvpers forum[^1^] [^2^], where many players share their emblems and request new ones. You can browse through hundreds of emblems in different categories, such as flags, animals, symbols, logos, etc. You can also request a custom emblem from other users who are skilled in graphic design.
 
## Step 2: Download and Rename the Emblem
 
The second step is to download and rename the emblem that you have chosen or created. To download an emblem from online sources, you need to right-click on the image and select "Save image as". Then, choose a location on your computer where you want to save the emblem.
 
To rename the emblem, you need to follow some rules:

- If you want to use the emblem for your guild, you need to name it "GuildMark.bmp".
- If you want to use the emblem for your union, you need to name it "UnionMark.bmp".
- If you want to use different emblems for your guild and union, you need to name them accordingly.

For example, if you want to use this emblem[^3^] for your guild and this emblem[^4^] for your union, you need to name them "GuildMark.bmp" and "UnionMark.bmp" respectively.
 
## Step 3: Copy and Paste the Emblem
 
The third step is to copy and paste the emblem that you have downloaded and renamed into the Silkroad Online folder on your computer. To do this, you need to locate the folder where you have installed Silkroad Online. The default location is usually "C:\Program Files\Silkroad".
 
Then, you need to open the folder and find a subfolder called "Media". Inside this folder, you will see two files called "GuildMark.bmp" and "UnionMark.bmp". These are the default emblems for guilds and unions in Silkroad Online. You need to replace these files with your own emblems.
 
To do this, you need to copy your emblems from the location where you have saved them on your computer. Then, you need to paste them into the "Media" folder of Silkroad Online. You will be asked if you want to overwrite the existing files. You need to click "Yes" or "Replace" to confirm.
